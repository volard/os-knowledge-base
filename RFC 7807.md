> Defines a JSON format, and an associated media type, with the JSON format defining an object that has five optional members for describing a problem detail

# Members
Name | Description
---- | ------
`type`|A URI reference that identifies the problem type. Ideally, the URI should resolve to human-readable information describing the type, but that’s not necessary. The problem type provides information that’s more specific than the HTTP status code itself. When this member is not present, its value is assumed to be `about:blank`. it is RECOMMENDED that absolute URIs be used in "type" when possible
`title`|A human-readable description of the problem _type_, meaning that it should **always be the same for the same type**.
`status`|This reflects the HTTP status code and is a convenient way to make problem details self-contained. That way they can be interpreted outside of the context of the HTTP interaction in which they were provided.
`detail`|A human-readable description of the problem _instance_, explaining why the problem occurred in this specific case.
`instance`|A URI reference that identifies the problem instance. Ideally, the URI should resolve to information describing the problem instance, but that’s not necessary.

# Problem details
When serialized as a JSON document, that format is identified with the `application/problem+json` media type.

For example, an HTTP response carrying JSON problem details:
```json
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
	"type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
	"title": "You do not have enough credit.",
	"detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
	"instance": "/account/12345/msgs/abc",
	"balance": 30,
	"accounts": ["/account/12345",
				 "/account/67890"]
}
```
