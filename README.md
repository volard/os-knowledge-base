# 🖥️ Operation systems notes
Poorly linked & partly Russian spoken (bruh).

Folders presented for historical reasons, but in general using file-picking from side panel is not the best navigation approach. 

Use `graph view` and `search prompt` instead.

## ✅ TODO
- [ ] Eliminate Russian
- [x] Eliminate anki connection templated notes
- [ ] Remove all long reads
- [x] Remove stupid stuff (like "uh what's difference between mobile and desktop GUI hmmm")
- [ ] Add new theory
	- [ ] memory
	- [ ] virtualization
	- [ ] containerization
	- [ ] active directory deeper
	- [ ] setup / deploy / OS (server OS)
	- [ ] security
	- [ ] a lot of …😭
- [ ] Complete linking
