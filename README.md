# Operation systems notes
Poorly organized & Russian spoken (bruh).
Folders presented for historical reasons and simple convenience, but in general using file-picking from side panel is not the best navigation approach.

## TODO
- [ ] Eliminate Russian
- [x] Eliminate anki connection templated notes
- [ ] Remove all long reads
- [x] Remove stupid stuff (like "uh what's difference between mobile and desktop GUI hmmm")
- [ ] Add new theory
	- [ ] virtualization
	- [ ] containerization
	- [ ] active directory deeper
	- [ ] clusterization
	- [ ] setup / deploy / OS (server OS)
	- [ ] security
- [ ] Complete linking
