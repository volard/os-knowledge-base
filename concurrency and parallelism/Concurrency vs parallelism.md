Here considered software terminology.

**Concurrency** is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time **periods**. #q (I don't get it fully - as I got it, concurrency is like one cashier simultaneously handle two or more queues).

**Parallelism** is when tasks _literally_ run at the same time, e.g., on a multicore processor.
