_process_ - in most current operating systems, an executed program’s code, and the operating system will manage multiple processes at once. 

Within a program, you can also have independent parts that run simultaneously. The features that run these independent parts are called _threads_. 

For example, a web server could have multiple threads so that it could respond to more than one request at the same time.
