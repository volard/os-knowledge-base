A common [[Domain|network domain]] designed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks

Stores info about objects and users on the network and provides a logical (not for me), hierarchical view of the directory information, making it easy for administrators and users to navigate the domain and find resources.

Typically includes one or more domain controllers for managing resources and users across the network

Uses [[LDAP]]
