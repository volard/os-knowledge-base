the router handles all the traffic from your computers and other devices out to the internet. So even though a website only sees a request come in from the [[IP address]] on the router, the router knows how to route the information to/from the computer. (That's why it's called a router)

Router itself can have either static, neither dynamic [[IP address]]

Uses [[routing schemes]] 

# Routing types
## Static
May use manually configured [[routing table]]

## Dynamic
Construct routing tables automatically, based on information carried by routing protocols,
