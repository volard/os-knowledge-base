> Virtual interface to connect back to the same machine

A special case of private link-local addresses.

These addresses are private and link-local by definition, since packets never leave the host device.

[[IPv4]] reserves the entire class A address block `127.0.0.0/8` for use as private loopback addresses.
[[IPv6]] reserves the single address `::1`.

**localhost** - [[hostname]] that refers to the current computer used to access it

SSRF localhost aliases http://localhost http://*.localhost http://127.1 http://127.0.0.0 http://127.0.0.1 http://2130706433 http://0177.1 http://0x7f.1 http://127.000.000.1 http://fbi .com http://[::1] http://[::] http://0
