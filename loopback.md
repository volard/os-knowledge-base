A special case of private link-local addresses.

These addresses are private and link-local by definition, since packets never leave the host device.

[[IP address|IPv4]] reserves the entire class A address block `127.0.0.0/8` for use as private loopback addresses. [[IP address|IPv6]] reserves the single address `::1`.

**localhost** - [[hostname]] that refers to the current computer used to access it
