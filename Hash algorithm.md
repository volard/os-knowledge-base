>Any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output

 The values returned by a hash function are called `hash values`, `hash codes`, `digests`, or `hashes`.
 
 The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a `hash table`. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called `hashing` or `scatter storage addressing`
