# [[CISC]] vs [[RISC]]

RISC | CISC
-----|------
Focus on software | Focus on hardware
Uses only hardwired control unit | Uses both hardwired and microprogrammed control unit
Transistors are used for more registers | Transistors are used for storing complex instructions
Fixed sized instructions | Can perform REG to REG or REG to MEM or MEM to MEM
Requires more number of registers | Requires less number of registers
Code size is large | Code size is shmallüê± 
An instruction executed in a single clock cycle | Instruction takes more than one clock cycle
An instruction fit in one word | Instructions are larger than the size of one word
