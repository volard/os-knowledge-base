>  Family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)

# Includes
- `SHA-0`, `SHA-1` - old unsecured trivial shit
- `SHA-2` - just two algorithms SHA-256 and SHA-512 and their variants: SHA-224, SHA-384, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256.
- `SHA-3` - differs from MD5-like structure of SHA-1 and SHA-2 and its a subset of the broader cryptographic primitive family Keccak
