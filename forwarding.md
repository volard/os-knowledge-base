> Relaying of packets from one network segment to another by nodes. 

The network layer in the OSI model is responsible for it

# Models
- Unicasing - packet being relayed from link to link along a chain leading from the packet's source to its destination
- Broadcasting within a broadcast domain
- multicasting, where a packet is selectively duplicated and copies delivered to each of a set of recipients
