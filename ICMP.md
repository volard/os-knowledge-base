> internet control message protocol

Used for network maintenance and debugging via sending packets between devices to indicate their availability or error conditions. 

These packets are used in a variety of network diagnostic tools, such as [[ping]], [[gping]] and `traceroute`

Usually ICMP packets are transmitted when a different kind of packet encounters a problem.
They are used as a feedback mechanism for network communications.
