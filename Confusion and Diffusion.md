> Mathematical cryptography principles written by Claude Shannon in 1945 (flashbacks)

**Confusion** means that each bit in the output form a cipher should depend on several parts of the key and input data and thus direct mapping cannot be established. 

**Diffusion** means that changing one bit in the input should change approximately half of the bits in the output. These principles are incorporated in most hash functions, MAC algorithms, random number generators, symmetric and asymmetric ciphers.
