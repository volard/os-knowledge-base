[[Protocol]] specifies how [[router|routers]] communicate with each other to distribute information that enables them to select routes between nodes on a computer [[network]]. 


Built around some routing algorithm, which can be selected in depend of used [[network topology|physical network topology]].

Each router has a prior knowledge only of networks attached to it directly. A routing protocol shares this information first among immediate neighbors, and then throughout the network. 

This way, routers gain knowledge of the topology of the network.
