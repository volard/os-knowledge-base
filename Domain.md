In general, a `domain` is an area of control or a sphere of knowledge.

The terms `domain` and `domain name` are often used interchangeably (in context of the [[internet]])

Domain is also used in other types of networks to describe the logical organization of connected physical network resources and users. This type of domain provides a structure for managing network resources and users under a single administrative umbrella.
