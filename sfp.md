**Small Form-factor Pluggable** - hot-pluggable network interface module format.

This module was created to handle amount of different [[Optical fiber connector|optical fiber connectors]] (about 100, Carl !).
Imagine the world where use can change USB port on your laptop to USB-C, or any other. That world exists in networking area.

The form factor and electrical interface are specified by mega cool committees.
