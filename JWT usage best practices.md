- Shouldn’t use JWTs as session tokens (what?)
- `HttpOnly` cookies and sensible [[CORS]] policies cannot prevent [[CSRF]] form-submit attacks and using cookies require a proper [[CSRF]] mitigation strategy
- The [OWASP JWT Cheatsheet](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/JSON_Web_Token_for_Java_Cheat_Sheet.md) and [OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS) prescribe guidelines for handling and storing tokens.
- Unsigned JWTs should be considered invalid to prevent Signature stripping attack
- All data should be validated to prevent [[XSS]]
- `HttpOnly` flag should be used to secure session data
- Monitor client and server data usage balance to build secure, scalable yet fast service
- _First sign the message and then encrypt the result_
