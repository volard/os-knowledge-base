> Operating-system-level virtualization

An operating system feature in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances. 

Such instances, called `containers`, `partitions`, `virtual environments (VEs)` or `jails` (FreeBSD jail or chroot jail), may look like real computers from the point of view of programs running in them.
