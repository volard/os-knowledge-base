an **unevenly** (or **unequally** or **irregularly**) **spaced time series** is a sequence of observation time and value pairs ($t_n, X_n$) in which the spacing of observation times is not constant.

(In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"), [signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing "Signal processing"), and [econometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics "Econometrics") ) 

A common approach to analyzing unevenly spaced time series is to transform the data into equally spaced observations using some form of [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation "Interpolation") - most often linear - and then to apply existing methods for equally spaced data.
