**Emulation** is an ability of a program in an electronic device to emulate (imitate) another program or device

**Emulator** is a software that enables one computer system (called the host) to behave like another computer system

Emulators rely on an interpreter - a program that reads the emulated guest system code instructions and executes semantically equivalent operations on the host system.
