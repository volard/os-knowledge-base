> It is a software testing technique that helps detect vulnerabilities in APIs

It does this by sending unexpected or invalid input data to the APIs

**Types**:
- Black-box - testing an API without any knowledge of its internal workings
- Grey-box - testing an API with some knowledge of its internal workings
- White-box - testers have access to the source code of the API
