A system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any variation of a physical quantity.

The specified behavior is typically independent of how it is to be implemented

To reach an agreement, a protocol may (and should) be developed into a technical standards, which are commonly created by obtaining the approval or support of a [[standards organization]]

A group of protocols designed to work together is known as a **protocol suite**; when implemented in software they are a **protocol stack**.
