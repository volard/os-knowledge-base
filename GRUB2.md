Previous version had been replaced by second one and now known as **GRUB Legacy**

Popular because it feature-rich:
- can boot multiple operating systems
- boots both a graphical and a text-based interface
- allows ease of use over a serial cable
- strong CLI for interactive configuration
- network-based diskless booting

To check for the GRUB version
```bash
sudo grub-install -V
```

Configuration location: `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`
