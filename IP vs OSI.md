# Choice
For many OSI is the preferable choice â€” all other things being equal. The fact that it segments the functions of the network into more layers makes troubleshooting and improving network performance more straightforward.

However, [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] has the advantage of having more applications, and it is commonly used in more current networking structures.

# Layers
TCP/IP predates OSI.

Differences in layer structure is a topic to continuous discussion.

TCP/IP | OSI
----- | -----
**Application** | **Application**
. | Presentation
. | Session
Host-to-host or **transport** | Transport
Internet | Network
Network access | Data link
**Physical** | **Physical**
Historical direction ``-------------------------->``

Looking back to history, it's visually easy to find that the most noticeable change in OSI model is more separated **Application** top level. Other lower level layer in, big picture, just the same.
