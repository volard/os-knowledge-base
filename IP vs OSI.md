> Protocol Wars

A long-running debate in computer science known as the Protocol Wars occurred from the 1970s to the 1990s when engineers, organizations and nations became polarized over the issue of which communication protocol would result in the best and most robust computer networks

# Choice
For many OSI is the preferable choice â€” all other things being equal. The fact that it segments the functions of the network into more layers makes troubleshooting and improving network performance more straightforward.

However, [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] has the advantage of having more applications, and it is commonly used in more current networking structures.

# Layers
TCP/IP predates OSI.

Differences in layer structure is a topic to continuous discussion.

TCP/IP | OSI
----- | -----
**Application** | **Application**
. | Presentation
. | Session
Host-to-host or **transport** | Transport
Internet | Network
Network access | Data link
**Physical** | **Physical**
Historical direction ``-------------------------->``

Looking back to history, it's visually easy to find that the most noticeable change in OSI model is more separated **Application** top level. Other lower level layer in, big picture, just the same.
