Cloud computing model depends on virtualization. By virtualizing servers, storage, and other physical data center resources, cloud computing providers can offer a range of services to customers, including the following: 

- **[Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas "iaas"):** Virtualized server, storage, and network resources you can configure based on their requirements.  
- **[Platform as a service (PaaS)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas "paas"):** Virtualized development tools, databases, and other cloud-based services you can use to build you own cloud-based applications and solutions.
- **[Software as a service (SaaS)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas)**: Software applications you use on the cloud. SaaS is the cloud-based service most abstracted from the hardware.
