> Standard in network security that requires all users inside and outside the organization’s network to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated for security configuration

# Core principles

- **Explicit verification**: Authenticate and authorize every user and device on every session
- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant the user access to the resources they are using at the time, and only for as long as they need
- **Assume a breach**: Limit access to resources, verify end-to-end encryption, use analytics to monitor network activity, detect threats, and adjust access policies.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides guidelines for implementing Zero Trust Security in publication [NIST 800-207](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final)
