> Programming style that treat computations as evaluating mathematical functions

In the 1930s, mathematician Alonzo Church developed **a formal system to express computations based on function abstraction.** This universal model of computation came to be known as [lambda calculus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/) (λ-calculus).

Functional programming languages implement lambda calculus.

# Concepts
- Pure functions
- Recursion
- Referential transparency
- Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order
- Variables are Immutable
