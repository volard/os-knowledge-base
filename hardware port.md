> An interface between the computer and other computers or peripheral devices

On the physical layer, refers to the part of a computing device available for connection with peripherals such as input and output devices

# Types 
- Analog ports
- Digital ports:
    - Parallel ports - send multiple bits at the same time over several sets of wires.
    - Serial ports - send and receive one bit at a time via a single wire pair (Ground and +/-)

- Hot-swappable ports can be connected while equipment is running.

- Plug-and-play ports are designed so that the connected devices automatically start handshaking as soon as the hot-swapping is done

An auto-detect port (which is usually also Plug-and-play) may automatically determine what kind of device has been attached, but it also determines what purpose the port itself should have
