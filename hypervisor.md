soft, firmware or hardware that runs [[virtual machine]](s)

`Hyper-` means stronger meaning than `super-` in [[supervisor]] (a traditional term for the [[Kernel]]). Consequently, the hypervisor is the supervisor of the supervisors, Â i.e. it's the kernel that controls kernels. ðŸ˜„

Unlike an [[emulator]], the guest executes most instructions on the native hardware without need of any kind of interpreter

# Types

## Type 1 or bare metall
OS designed to run VMs. It is installed directly on the disk to be executed from the boot sector like any OS

## Type 2
Run as an application on an existing OS. Most commonly used on endpoint devices to run alternative operating systems, they carry a performance overhead because they must use the host OS to access and coordinate the underlying hardware resources.
