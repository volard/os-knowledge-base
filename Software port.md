> The process of adapting software for the purpose of execution in a computing environment that is different from the one that a given program was originally designed for

Software is portable when the cost of porting it to a new platform is significantly less than the cost of writing it from scratch

# Terminology
The term is derived from the Latin `portƒÅre`, meaning `to carry`. When code is not compatible with a particular operating system or architecture, the code must be "carried" to the new system.
